# MIPS_3
MIPS lab 3

Lab 3 from UARK Comp Org lab is broken into three parts. The first part takes in three integers from the user and adds them together. Part 2 prints out a pre-defined array of integers. Part 3 takes in 10 integers into an array, then a search integer. It then displays all the indexes where the search integer is found and the number of times it occurs in the array.
